### Hi there 👋 I'm Ivy 

### 🌼 A little bit about me 

I'm a frontend developer (working my way towards fullstack) based in Taipei, Taiwan by way of San Francisco. I've been curiously dabbling in web development since 2017 when I first joined my friends at a hackathon at the Github headquarters in SF. Quickly after that, I began self-learning online through various platforms and helped organize hackathons on campus and remotely. In college, my background has primarily been in cognitive science and product design. However, I'm taking a leap of faith and dedicating more focused time to web development starting this summer 2023. 


### ☘️ Currently working on
- A vocabulary-building web app inspired by my students learning English at the place I work part-time at 🔡
- Meta's frontend developer certificate & Google's advanced data analytics certificate 🗒️ 


🌱 I'm open to opportunities in Taipei or remote. Feel free to email me at ivy0925chen@gmail.com to get in touch.
