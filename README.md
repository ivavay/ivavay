### Hi there 👋 I'm Ivy 

### 🌼 A little bit about me 

I'm a frontend developer based in Taipei, Taiwan by way of San Francisco. I've been curiously dabbling in web development since 2017 when I first joined my friends at a hackathon at the Github headquarters in SF. Quickly after that, I began self-learning online through various platforms and helped organize hackathons [on campus](https://2020.cruzhacks.com/) and [remotely](https://www.sospectra.com/). In college, my background has primarily been in cognitive science and product design. However, I'm taking a leap of faith and dedicating more focused time to web development starting this summer 2023.
